Powering a Home Data Centre

Installation and power management for a home datacentre.

This is the repository for the files accompanying an ongoing project, where I install and build network power remote control and monitoring into my home network.

Files for each PCB comprising the project are placed together in separate direcrories for each PCB.

Construction notes for each PCB are included with the files for that PCB.
