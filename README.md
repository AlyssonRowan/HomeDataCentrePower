Powering a Home Data Centre Project
===================================

Installation and power management for a home datacentre
-------------------------------------------------------

**About:**
This is the repository for the files accompanying an ongoing hardware project, where I install a home network server stack, and build in network power remote control and monitoring into an existing home network. The project article is on Blogger.

The project will hopefully give insight into power and environmental monitoring, power control and non-IoT network remote control and monitoring. The monitoring alone could be applied to the multiple mains circuits in a domestic environment, giving a more granular measurement of where power is being used than a _Smart Meter_ can give.

Files for the circuit boards comprising the hardware aspects of the project are placed together, with separate directories for each PCB.

Construction notes for each PCB are included with the files for that PCB.

Presently, the project is only suitable for single-phase supplies. Hopefully, there will be a 3-phase version at some point in the future.
